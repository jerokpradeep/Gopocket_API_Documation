## Response 

All GET and DELETE request parameters go as query parameters, and POST and PUT parameters as form-encoded (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) parameters, responses from the API are always JSON.

## Exceptions


Content-Type: application/json
``` 
{
"status":"Ok",
"message":"Success"
"result":[]
}

```
All responses from the API server are JSON with the content-type application/json unless explicitly stated otherwise. A successful 200 OK response always has a JSON response body with a status key with the value success. The data key contains the full response payload.

## Errors


Content-Type: application/json
``` 
{
"status":"error",
"message":"Error message",
"error_type":"GeneralException"

}
``` 
A failure response is preceded by the corresponding 40x or 50x HTTP header. The status key in the response envelope contains the value error. The message key contains a textual description of the error and error_type contains the name of the exception. There may be an optional data key with additional payload.

__Data types:__

* Values in JSON responses are of types string, int, float, or boolean.

* Timestamp (datetime) strings in the responses are represented in the form yyyy-mm-dd hh:ss, set under the Indian timezone (IST) — UTC+5.5 hours.

* A date string is represented in the form yyyy-mm-dd.

<!-- ### Exceptions and errors

In addition to the 40x and 50x headers, error responses come with the name of the exception generated internally by the API server. You can define corresponding exceptions in your language or library, and raise them by doing a switch on the returned exception name.

__Example__


HTTP/1.1 500 Server error

Content-Type: application/json

``` yaml
{
   "status":"error",
"message":"Error message",
"error_type":"GeneralException"

}
``` -->
