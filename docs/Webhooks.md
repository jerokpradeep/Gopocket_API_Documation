title: Postback (WebHooks)
---

The Postback API sends a `POST` request with a JSON payload to the registered postback_url of your app when an order's status changes. This enables you to get arbitrary updates to your orders reliably, irrespective of when they happen (`COMPLETE`, `CANCEL`, `REJECTED`, `UPDATE`). An UPDATE postback is triggered when an open order is modified or when there's a partial fill. This can be used to track trades.

```
For individual developers, Postbacks over [WebSocket](websocket.md) is recommended, where, orders placed for a particular user anywhere, for instance, web, mobile, or desktop platforms, are sent.

```
The JSON payload is posted as a raw HTTP POST body. You will have to read the raw body and then decode it.

## Checksum  

The JSON payload comes with a checksum, which is the SHA-256 hash of (order_id + order_timestamp + api_secret). For every Postback you receive, you should compute this checksum at your end and match it with the checksum in the payload. This is to ensure that the update is being POSTed by Kite Connect and not by an unauthorised entity, as only Kite Connect can generate a checksum that contains your api_secret.
